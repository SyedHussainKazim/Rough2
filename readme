# LTCG Calculator for Real Estate Investments in India

## Description

This C++ program calculates the Long-term Capital Gains Tax (LTCG) on real estate investments in India, as per two taxation schemes:
1. **Original LTCG Scheme** (with 20% tax and inflation adjustment).
2. **New LTCG Scheme (2024)** (with 12.5% tax and no inflation adjustment).

The program takes the year of selling the property as input, calculates the estimated selling price, and then computes the LTCG under both schemes. It also compares the taxes under both schemes to show which one results in a higher tax and by how much.

This program uses a CSV file (`Growth-price.csv`) that contains the yearly inflation rate and growth rate of property prices from 2001 to 2029.

## Instructions for Building the Program

### Required Files:
- **main.cpp**: The C++ source code file.
- **Makefile**: The Makefile to build the program.
- **Growth-price.csv**: The input CSV file containing data on property growth and inflation rates.

### Steps to Build the Program:

1. **Clone or Download the Project**:
   Ensure that all required files (`main.cpp`, `Makefile`, and `Growth-price.csv`) are in the same directory.

2. **Open a Terminal**:
   Navigate to the directory containing the files.

3. **Build the Program**:
   Use the following commands to compile the program:

   - For **debugging** version:
     ```bash
     make debug
     ```

   - For **optimized** version:
     ```bash
     make optimized
     ```

   This will generate two executable binaries:
   - `ltcg_calculator_debug`: A debug version with symbols for debugging.
   - `ltcg_calculator_optimized`: An optimized version for efficient execution.

4. **Clean the Build**:
   To remove the compiled binaries, use the following command:
   ```bash
   make clean
   ```

## Running the Program

1. **Run the Debug or Optimized Binary**:
   After compilation, you can run the appropriate version:

   - **Debug version**:
     ```bash
     ./ltcg_calculator_debug
     ```

   - **Optimized version**:
     ```bash
     ./ltcg_calculator_optimized
     ```

2. **Provide Input**:
   The program will prompt you to enter the year of selling the property.

   Example input:
   ```
   Enter the year of selling: 2025
   ```

3. **Output**:
   The program will output:
   - The estimated selling price of the property.
   - The LTCG calculated using the original taxation scheme.
   - The LTCG calculated using the new taxation scheme.
   - The difference between the two taxes.

## Input File Format

The input file is a CSV file named `Growth-price.csv` and should have the following format:

| Year        | Growth-Price | Inflation |
|-------------|--------------|-----------|
| 2001-12-31  | 4.824        | 3.7793    |
| 2002-12-31  | 3.804        | 4.2972    |
| ...         | ...          | ...       |
| 2029-12-31  | 6.5          | 6.5       |

- **Year**: The year corresponding to the property growth and inflation rates.
- **Growth-Price**: The growth rate of property prices in percentage (%).
- **Inflation**: The inflation rate in percentage (%).

This file contains data from 2001 to 2029. The program uses this data to calculate the inflation-adjusted cost price and the selling price of the property.
